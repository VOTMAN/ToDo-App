# To-Do App

A Todo App which allows you to add tasks, change their priority and delete completed tasks. Plan to user auth and backend so the tasks can be saved and viewed when logged in

Added the ability to post, delete, and get from the db at the start of the page load.

Include you're own credentials in a `.env` file in the src/backend folder
